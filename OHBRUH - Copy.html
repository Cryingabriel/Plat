In 2006, the head of NASA appointed Dr. Tyson to serve on its prestigious Advisory Council.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Dr. Tyson strayed away from traditional thinking in order to keep Pluto from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center.

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the dwarf planet classification (Hayden Planetarium) <br>

He is a great scientist and has helped predict alot of what things would happen in simplified ways too! Explaining and talking in interviews and podcasts</b>. <br>
